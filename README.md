### Try It Out
---
[Play it here](https://j-winston.github.io/Javascript-Tic-Tac-Toe/)

### Introduction 
---
This project was really an opportunity to try and separate view from data in javascript. I really wanted to work on 
taming the dumpster fire programs that result from trying to do everything from the DOM. Instead, I aimed to create 
a solid foundation of code that worked without, and independently of, the DOM. 

### Technologies 
---
HTML/CSS/Javascript

### Features 
---
* Readable, and modular code can be extended rather easily
* All modules except one are completely blind to each other
* Code skeleton could function without any DOM references

### Inspiration 
---
My inspiration was this article by Alex Younger on the consquences of interacting with the DOM too freely. ["Building a House from the Inside Out](https://www.ayweb.dev/blog/building-a-house-from-the-inside-out).
It totally resonated with me, and that's because I've been guilty as sin of doing it, as Javascript makes it too easy. This time I wanted to literally create from the inside out.

What really got me on this project was game flow--dealing with event driven nature of Javascript. Instead of promises, I wanted to use the old-school callback methods 
to challenge myself. This was surprisingly challenging and can easily result in code that is hard to follow, though I did learn some nice naming conventions along the way ie 'onSubmit'
